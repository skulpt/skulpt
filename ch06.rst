Fruitful functions
==================

.. index:: return statement, return value, temporary variable,
           dead code, None, unreachable code

.. index::
    single: value 
    single: variable; temporary 

Return values
-------------

The built-in functions we have used, such as ``abs``, ``pow``, ``int``, ``max``, and ``range``,
have produced results. Calling each of these functions generates a value, which
we usually assign to a variable or use as part of an expression.

.. sourcecode:: python
    
    biggest = max(3, 7, 2, 5)
    x = abs(3 - 11) + 10 

We also wrote our own function to return the final amount for a compound interest calculation.

In this chapter, we are going to write more functions that return values, which we
will call *fruitful functions*, for want of a better name.  The first example
is ``area``, which returns the area of a circle with the given radius:

.. sourcecode:: python
    
    def area(radius):
        b = 3.14159 * radius**2
        return b

We have seen the ``return`` statement before, but in a fruitful function the
``return`` statement includes a **return value**. This statement means: evaluate 
the return expression, and then return it immediately as the result (the fruit)
of this function.  The expression provided can be arbitrarily complicated, 
so we could have written this function more concisely:

.. sourcecode:: python
    
    def area(radius):
        return 3.14159 * radius**2

On the other hand, **temporary variables** like ``b`` above often make debugging
easier.

Sometimes it is useful to have multiple return statements, one in each branch
of a conditional. We have already seen the built-in ``abs``, now we see how to
write our own: 

.. sourcecode:: python
    
    def absolute_value(x):
        if x < 0:
            return -x
        else:
            return x



Another way to write the above function is to leave out the ``else`` and just
follow the ``if`` condition by the second ``return`` statement.

.. sourcecode:: python
    
    def absolute_value(x):
        if x < 0:
            return -x
        return x

Think about this version and convince yourself it works the same as the first
one.
  
Code that appears after a ``return`` statement, or any other place the flow of
execution can never reach, is called **dead code**, or **unreachable code**.

In a fruitful function, it is a good idea to ensure that every possible path
through the program hits a ``return`` statement. The following version of
``absolute_value`` fails to do this:

.. sourcecode:: python
    
    def absolute_value(x):
        if x < 0:
            return -x
        elif x > 0:
            return x

This version is not correct because if ``x`` happens to be 0, neither condition
is true, and the function ends without hitting a ``return`` statement. In this
case, the return value is a special value called **None**:

.. sourcecode:: python
    
    >>> print(absolute_value(0))
    None

All Python functions return ``None`` whenever they do not return another value.

It is also possible to use a return statement in the middle of a ``for`` loop,
in which case control immediately returns from the function.  Let us assume that we want
a function which looks through a list of words.  It should return the
first 2-letter word.  If there is not one, it should return the 
empty string:

.. sourcecode:: python
    
    def find_first_2_letter_word(xs):
        for wd in xs:
            if len(wd) == 2:
               return wd
        return ""

    test(find_first_2_letter_word(["This",  "is", "a", "dead", "parrot"]), "is")   
    test(find_first_2_letter_word(["I",  "like",  "cheese"]), "")     

Single-step through this code and convince yourself that in the first test case
that we've provided, the function returns while processing the second element
in the list: it does not have to traverse the whole list.  


.. index:: scaffolding, incremental development

Program development
-------------------

At this point, you should be able to look at complete functions and tell what
they do. Also, if you have been doing the exercises, you have written some
small functions. As you write larger functions, you might start to have more
difficulty, especially with runtime and semantic errors.

To deal with increasingly complex programs, we are going to suggest a technique
called **incremental development**. The goal of incremental development is to
avoid long debugging sessions by adding and testing only a small amount of code
at a time.

As an example, suppose you want to find the distance between two points, given
by the coordinates (x\ :sub:`1`\ , y\ :sub:`1`\ ) and
(x\ :sub:`2`\ , y\ :sub:`2`\ ).  By the Pythagorean theorem, the distance is:

.. image:: illustrations/distance_formula.png
   :alt: Distance formula 

The first step is to consider what a ``distance`` function should look like in
Python. In other words, what are the inputs (parameters) and what is the output
(return value)?

In this case, the two points are the inputs, which we can represent using four
parameters. The return value is the distance, which is a floating-point value.

Already we can write an outline of the function that captures our thinking so far:

.. sourcecode:: python
    
    def distance(x1, y1, x2, y2):
        return 0.0

Obviously, this version of the function doesn't compute distances; it always
returns zero. But it is syntactically correct, and it will run, which means
that we can test it before we make it more complicated.

To test the new function, we call it with sample values:

.. sourcecode:: python
    
    >>> distance(1, 2, 4, 6)
    0.0

We chose these values so that the horizontal distance equals 3 and the vertical
distance equals 4; that way, the result is 5 (the hypotenuse of a 3-4-5
triangle). When testing a function, it is useful to know the right answer.

At this point we have confirmed that the function is syntactically correct, and
we can start adding lines of code. After each incremental change, we test the
function again. If an error occurs at any point, we know where it must be --- in
the last line we added.

A logical first step in the computation is to find the differences
x\ :sub:`2`\ - x\ :sub:`1`\  and y\ :sub:`2`\ - y\ :sub:`1`\ .  We will store
those values in temporary variables named ``dx`` and ``dy``.

.. sourcecode:: python
    
    def distance(x1, y1, x2, y2):
        dx = x2 - x1
        dy = y2 - y1
        return 0.0

If we call the function with the arguments shown above, when the flow of execution
gets to the return statement, `dx` should be 3 and `dy` should be 4. 
We can check that this is the case in **PyScripter** by putting the cursor on
the return statement, and running the program to break execution 
when it gets to the cursor (using the `F4` key).
Then we inspect the variables ``dx`` and ``dy`` by hovering the mouse above
them, to confirm that the function is getting the right parameters and performing the first
computation correctly. If not, there are only a few lines to check.

Next we compute the sum of squares of ``dx`` and ``dy``:

.. sourcecode:: python
    
    def distance(x1, y1, x2, y2):
        dx = x2 - x1
        dy = y2 - y1
        dsquared = dx**2 + dy**2
        return 0.0

Again, we could run the program at this stage and check the value of ``dsquared`` (which
should be 25).

Finally, using the fractional exponent ``0.5`` to find the square root,
we compute and return the result:

.. sourcecode:: python
    
    def distance(x1, y1, x2, y2):
        dx = x2 - x1
        dy = y2 - y1
        dsquared = dx**2 + dy**2
        result = dsquared**0.5
        return result

If that works correctly, you are done. Otherwise, you might want to inspect the
value of ``result`` before the return statement.

When you start out, you might add only a line or two of code at a time. As you
gain more experience, you might find yourself writing and debugging bigger
conceptual chunks. Either way, stepping through your code one line at a time and 
veryifying that each step matches your expectations can save you a lot of
debugging time.  As you improve your programming skills you should find yourself
managing bigger and bigger chunks: this is very similar to the way we learnt to read
letters, syllables, words, phrases, sentences, paragraphs, etc., or the way we learn
to chunk music --- from indvidual notes to chords, bars, phrases, and so on.  

The key aspects of the process are:

#. Start with a working skeleton program and make small incremental changes. At any
   point, if there is an error, you will know exactly where it is.
#. Use temporary variables to hold intermediate values so that you can easily inspect
   and check them.
#. Once the program is working, you might want to consolidate multiple statements 
   into compound expressions,
   but only do this if it does not make the program more difficult to read.

.. index:: debugging   
   
Debugging with ``print``
------------------------

Another powerful technique for debugging is to insert ``print`` functions
in carefully selected places in your code.  Then, by inspecting the output
of the program, you can check whether the algorithm is doing what you expect
it to.  Be clear about the following, however:

* You must have a clear solution to the problem, and must know what should
  happen before you can debug a program.  Work on *solving* the problem
  on a piece of paper (perhaps using a flowchart to record the steps you take)
  *before* you concern yourself with
  writing code.  Writing a program doesn't solve the problem --- it simply *automates* 
  the manual steps you would take. So first make sure you have
  a pen-and-paper manual solution that works.  
  Programming then is about making those manual steps happen automatically. 
* Do not write **chatterbox** functions.  A chatterbox is a fruitful
  function that, in addition to its primary task, also asks the user for input, 
  or prints output, when it would be more useful
  if it simply shut up and did its work quietly.  
  
  For example, we've seen built-in functions like ``range``,
  ``max`` and ``abs``.  None of these would be useful building blocks for other
  programs if they prompted the user for input, or printed their results while
  they performed their tasks.
   
  So a good tip is to avoid calling ``print`` and ``input`` functions inside 
  fruitful functions, *unless the primary purpose of your function is to
  perform input and output*.  The one exception
  to this rule might be to temporarily sprinkle some calls to ``print`` into
  your code to help debug and understand what is happening when the code runs,
  but these will then be removed once you get things working.

   
.. index:: composition, function composition

Composition
-----------

As you should expect by now, you can call one function from within another.
This ability is called **composition**.

As an example, we'll write a function that takes two points, the center of the
circle and a point on the perimeter, and computes the area of the circle.

Assume that the center point is stored in the variables ``xc`` and ``yc``, and
the perimeter point is in ``xp`` and ``yp``. The first step is to find the
radius of the circle, which is the distance between the two points.
Fortunately, we've just written a function, ``distance``, that does just that,
so now all we have to do is use it:

.. sourcecode:: python
    
    radius = distance(xc, yc, xp, yp)

The second step is to find the area of a circle with that radius and return it.
Again we will use one of our earlier functions:

.. sourcecode:: python
    
    result = area(radius)
    return result

Wrapping that up in a function, we get:

.. sourcecode:: python
    
    def area2(xc, yc, xp, yp):
        radius = distance(xc, yc, xp, yp)
        result = area(radius)
        return result

We called this function ``area2`` to distinguish it from the ``area`` function
defined earlier. There can only be one function with a given name within a
module.

The temporary variables ``radius`` and ``result`` are useful for development,
debugging, and single-stepping through the code to inspect what is happening,
but once the program is working, we can make it more concise by
composing the function calls:

.. sourcecode:: python
    
    def area2(xc, yc, xp, yp):
        return area(distance(xc, yc, xp, yp))


.. index:: boolean function

Boolean functions
-----------------

Functions can return boolean values, which is often convenient for hiding
complicated tests inside functions. For example:

.. sourcecode:: python
    
    def is_divisible(x, y):
        if x % y == 0:
            return True 
        else:
            return False 

The name of this function is ``is_divisible``. It is common to give **boolean
functions** names that sound like yes/no questions.  ``is_divisible`` returns
either ``True`` or ``False`` to indicate whether the ``x`` is or is not
divisible by ``y``.

We can make the function more concise by taking advantage of the fact that the
condition of the ``if`` statement is itself a boolean expression. We can return
it directly, avoiding the ``if`` statement altogether:

.. sourcecode:: python
    
    def is_divisible(x, y):
        return x % y == 0

This session shows the new function in action:

.. sourcecode:: python
    
    >>> is_divisible(6, 4)
    False
    >>> is_divisible(6, 3)
    True

Boolean functions are often used in conditional statements:

.. sourcecode:: python
    
    if is_divisible(x, y):
        ... # do something ...
    else:
        ... # do something else ...

It might be tempting to write something like:

.. sourcecode:: python
    
    if is_divisible(x, y) == True:


but the extra comparison is unnecessary.

.. index:: style

Programming with style
----------------------

Readability is very important to programmers, since in practice programs are
read and modified far more often then they are written.  All the code examples
in this book will be consistent with the *Python Enhancement Proposal 8*
(`PEP 8 <http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/>`__), a style guide developed by the Python community.

We'll have more to say about style as our programs become more complex, but a
few pointers will be helpful already:

* use 4 spaces for indentation
* imports should go at the top of the file
* separate function definitions with two blank lines
* keep function definitions together
* keep top level statements, including function calls, together at the
  bottom of the program


Unit testing 
------------

It is a common best practice in software development these days to include
automatic **unit testing** of source code. Unit testing provides a way to
automatically verify that individual pieces of code, such as functions, are
working properly. This makes it possible to change the implementation of a
function at a later time and quickly test that it still does what it was
intended to do.

Unit testing also forces the programmer to think about the different cases 
that the function needs to handle.  You also only have to type the tests once
into the script, rather than having to keep entering the same test data over
and over as you develop your code.

Extra code in your program which is there because it makes debugging or testing
easier is called **scaffolding**.  

A collection of tests for some code is called its **test suite**.  

There are a few different preferred ways to do unit testing in Python --- 
but at this stage we're going to ignore what the Python community ususally does, 
and we're going to start with two functions that we'll write ourselves.
We'll use these for writing our unit tests.

Let's start with the ``absolute_value`` function that we wrote earlier in this
chapter.  Recall that we wrote a few different versions, the last of which was
incorrect, and had a bug. Would tests have help catch this bug?

First we plan our tests.  We'd like to know
if the function returns the correct value when its argument is negative,
or when its argument is positive, or when its argument is zero.  When
planning your tests, you'll always want to think carefully about the "edge" cases ---
here, an argument of 0 to ``absolute_value`` is on the edge of where the function
behaviour changes, and as we saw at the beginning of the chapter, it is an easy
spot for the programmer to make a mistake!  So it is a good case to include in
our test suite. 
 
We're going to write a helper function for checking the results of one test.  It
takes two arguments --- the actual value that was
returned from the computation, and the value we expected to get.
It compares these, and will either print
a message telling us that the test passed, or it will print a message to
inform us that the test failed.  The first two lines of the body (after
the function's docstring) can be copied to your own code as they are here:
they import a module called ``sys``, and extract the caller's
line number from the stack frame.  This allows us to print the line number
of the test, which will help when we want to fix any tests that fail. 

.. sourcecode:: python

    def test(actual, expected):
        """ Compare the actual to the expected value, and print a suitable message. """
        import sys
        linenum = sys._getframe(1).f_lineno         # get the caller's line number.
        if (expected == actual):
            msg = "Test on line {0} passed.".format(linenum)
        else:
            msg = "Test on line {0} failed. Expected '{1}', but got '{2}'.".format(linenum, expected, actual)
        print(msg)
 
There is also some slightly tricky string formatting using the ``format`` method which we will
gloss over for the moment, and cover in detail in a future chapter.  
But with this function written, we can proceed to construct our test suite:

.. sourcecode:: python
    
    def test_suite():
        """ Run the suite of tests for code in this module (this file) """
        test(absolute_value(17), 17)  
        test(absolute_value(-17), 17) 
        test(absolute_value(0), 0) 
        test(absolute_value(3.14), 3.14) 
        test(absolute_value(-3.14), 3.14) 
    
    test_suite()        # and here is the call to run the tests
    
Here you'll see that we've constructed five tests in our test suite.  We could run this
against the first or second versions (the correct versions) of ``absolute_value``, and we'd get output similar to the following:: 

    Test on line 24 passed.
    Test on line 25 passed.
    Test on line 26 passed.
    Test on line 27 passed.
    Test on line 28 passed.

But let's say you change the function to an incorrect version like this:

.. sourcecode:: python
 
    def absolute_value(n):   # Buggy version
        """ Compute the absolute value of n """  
        if n < 0:
            return 1
        elif n > 0:
            return n
    
Can you find at least two mistakes in this code?  Running our test suite we get::

    Test on line 24 passed.
    Test on line 25 failed. Expected '17', but got '1'.
    Test on line 26 failed. Expected '0', but got 'None'.
    Test on line 27 passed.
    Test on line 28 failed. Expected '3.14', but got '1'.

These are three examples of *failing tests*.

Exercises
---------

All of the exercises below should be added to a single file.  In that file, you should
also add the ``test`` and ``test_suite`` scaffolding functions shown above, and then, as you work through the exercises, add the new tests to your test suite. 

After completing each exercise, confirm that all the tests pass.

#. Write a function ``to_secs`` that converts hours, minutes and seconds to 
   a total number of seconds.  Here are some tests that should pass::
   
       test(to_secs(2, 30, 10), 9010)
       test(to_secs(2, 0, 0), 7200)
       test(to_secs(0, 2, 0), 120)
       test(to_secs(0, 0, 42), 42)
       test(to_secs(0, -10, 10), -590)
       
#. Extend ``to_secs`` so that it can cope with real values as inputs.  It
   should always return an integer number of seconds (truncated towards zero):: 

       test(to_secs(2.5, 0, 10.71), 9010)
       test(to_secs(2.433,0,0), 8758)  
       
#. Write three functions that are the "inverses" of ``to_secs``:
   
   #. ``hours_in`` returns the whole integer number of hours
      represented by a total number of seconds.
      
   #. ``minutes_in`` returns the whole integer number of left over minutes
      in a total number of seconds, once the hours
      have been taken out.
      
   #. ``seconds_in`` returns the left over seconds
      represented by a total number of seconds.
      
   You may assume that the total number of seconds passed to these functions is an integer.
   Here are some test cases::
   
       test(hours_in(9010), 2)
       test(minutes_in(9010), 30)
       test(seconds_in(9010), 10)
       
#. Which of these tests fail?  Explain why. ::

       test(3 % 4, 0)
       test(3 % 4, 3)
       test(3 / 4, 0)
       test(3 // 4, 0)
       test(3+4  *  2, 14)
       test(4-2+2, 0)
       test(len("hello, world!"), 13)
       
#. Write a ``compare`` function that returns ``1`` if ``a > b``, ``0`` if
   ``a == b``, and ``-1`` if ``a < b`` ::
    
       test(compare(5, 4), 1)
       test(compare(7, 7, 0)
       test(compare(2, 3), -1)
       test(compare(42, 1), 1)

#. Write a function called ``hypotenuse`` that
   returns the length of the hypotenuse of a right triangle given the lengths
   of the two legs as parameters::
    
       test(hypotenuse(3, 4), 5.0)
       test(hypotenuse(12, 5), 13.0)
       test(hypotenuse(24, 7), 25.0)
       test(hypotenuse(9, 12), 15.0)
 
#. Write a function ``slope(x1, y1, x2, y2)`` that returns the slope of
   the line through the points (x1, y1) and (x2, y2). Be sure your
   implementation of ``slope`` can pass the following tests::
    
       test(slope(5, 3, 4, 2), 1.0)
       test(slope(1, 2, 3, 2), 0.0)
       test(slope(1, 2, 3, 3), 0.5)
       test(slope(2, 4, 1, 2), 2.0)

   Then use a call to ``slope`` in a new function named
   ``intercept(x1, y1, x2, y2)`` that returns the y-intercept of the line
   through the points ``(x1, y1)`` and ``(x2, y2)`` ::

       test(intercept(1, 6, 3, 12), 3.0)

#. Write a function called ``is_even(n)`` that takes an integer as an argument
   and returns ``True`` if the argument is an **even number** and ``False`` if
   it is **odd**.
   
   Add your own tests to the test suite.
   
#. Now write the function ``is_odd(n)`` that returns ``True`` when ``n`` is odd
   and ``False`` otherwise. Include unit tests for this function too. 

   Finally, modify it so that it uses a call to ``is_even`` to determine if its 
   argument is an odd integer, and ensure that its test still pass.
   
#. Write a function ``is_factor(f, n)`` that passes these tests::
    
      test(is_factor(3, 12), True) 
      test(is_factor(5, 12), False) 
      test(is_factor(7, 14), True) 
      test(is_factor(7, 15), False) 
      test(is_factor(1, 15), True) 
      test(is_factor(15, 15), True) 
      test(is_factor(25, 15), False)
       
   An important role of unit tests is that they can also
   act as unambiguous "specifications" of what is expected.  These test
   cases answer the question *Do we treat 1 and 15 as factors of 15?*    
 
#. Write ``is_multiple`` to satisfy these unit tests::
    
       test(is_multiple(12, 3), True)
       test(is_multiple(12, 4), True)
       test(is_multiple(12, 5), False)
       test(is_multiple(12, 6), True)
       test(is_multiple(12, 7), False)

   Can you find a way to use ``is_factor`` in your definition of ``is_multiple``?

#. Write the function ``f2c(t)`` designed to return the
   integer value of the nearest degree Celsius for given tempurature in
   Fahrenheit. (*hint:* you may want to make use of the built-in function,
   ``round``. Try printing ``round.__doc__`` in a Python shell or looking up
   help for the ``round`` function, and
   experimenting with it until you are comfortable with how it works.) ::
    
        test(f2c(212), 100)     # boiling point of water
        test(f2c(32), 0)        # freezing point of water
        test(f2c(-40), -40)     # Wow, what an interesting case! 
        test(f2c(36), 2)
        test(f2c(37), 3)
        test(f2c(38), 3)
        test(f2c(39), 4)

#. Now do the opposite: write the function ``c2f`` which converts Celcius to Fahrenheit:: 
  
        test(c2f(0), 32)
        test(c2f(100), 212)
        test(c2f(-40), -40)
        test(c2f(12), 54)
        test(c2f(18), 64)
        test(c2f(-48) -54)
