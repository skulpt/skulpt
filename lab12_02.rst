Letter Count Histogram
======================

The previous lab wrote a function to return a dictionary of letter counts.  In an earlier chapter, we wrote a turtle
program that could draw a histogram.

Combine these two ideas together to create a function that will take a string and create a histogram of the number of
times each letter occurs.  Make sure it is in alphabetical order from left to right.

#. Count the number of times each letter occurs.  Keep the count in a dictionary.

#. Get the keys from the dictionary, convert them to a list, and sort them.

#. Iterate through the keys, in alphabetical order, getting the associated value (count).

#. Make a histogram bar for each.
