Dictionaries
============

.. index:: dictionary, mapping type, key, value, key-value pair

All of the compound data types we have studied in detail so far --- strings,
lists, and tuples --- are sequence types, which use integers as indices to access
the values they contain within them.

**Dictionaries** are a different kind of compound type. They are Python's
built-in **mapping type**. They map **keys**, which can be any immutable type,
to values, which can be any type, just like the values of a list or tuple.

As an example, we will create a dictionary to translate English words into
Spanish. For this dictionary, the keys are strings.

One way to create a dictionary is to start with the empty dictionary and add
**key-value pairs**. The empty dictionary is denoted ``{}``:

.. sourcecode:: python
    
    >>> eng2sp = {}
    >>> eng2sp['one'] = 'uno'
    >>> eng2sp['two'] = 'dos'

The first assignment creates a dictionary named ``eng2sp``; the other
assignments add new key-value pairs to the dictionary. We can print the current
value of the dictionary in the usual way:

.. sourcecode:: python
    
    >>> print(eng2sp)
    {'two': 'dos', 'one': 'uno'}

The key-value pairs of the dictionary are seperated by commas. Each pair
contains a key and a value separated by a colon.

The order of the pairs may not be what you expected. Python uses complex
algorithms, designed for very fast access, to determine where the 
key-value pairs are stored in a dictionary.
For our purposes we can think of this ordering as unpredicatable.

Another way to create a dictionary is to provide a list of key-value pairs
using the same syntax as the previous output:

.. sourcecode:: python
    
    >>> eng2sp = {'one': 'uno', 'two': 'dos', 'three': 'tres'}

It doesn't matter what order we write the pairs. The values in a dictionary are
accessed with keys, not with indices, so there is no need to care about
ordering.

Here is how we use a key to look up the corresponding value:

.. sourcecode:: python
    
    >>> print(eng2sp['two'])
    'dos'

The key ``'two'`` yields the value ``'dos'``.


Dictionary operations
---------------------

The ``del`` statement removes a key-value pair from a dictionary. For example,
the following dictionary contains the names of various fruits and the number of
each fruit in stock:

.. sourcecode:: python
    
    >>> inventory = {'apples': 430, 'bananas': 312, 'oranges': 525, 'pears': 217}
    >>> print(inventory)
    {'pears': 217, 'apples': 430, 'oranges': 525, 'bananas': 312}

If someone buys all of the pears, we can remove the entry from the dictionary:

.. sourcecode:: python
    
    >>> del inventory['pears']
    >>> print(inventory)
    {'apples': 430, 'oranges': 525, 'bananas': 312}

Or if we're expecting more pears soon, we might just change the value
associated with pears:

.. sourcecode:: python
    
    >>> inventory['pears'] = 0
    >>> print(inventory)
    {'pears': 0, 'apples': 430, 'oranges': 525, 'bananas': 312}
    
A new shipment of bananas arriving could be handled like this:

.. sourcecode:: python
    
    >>> inventory['bananas'] += 200
    >>> print(inventory)
    {'pears': 0, 'apples': 430, 'oranges': 525, 'bananas': 512}

The ``len`` function also works on dictionaries; it returns the number
of key-value pairs:

.. sourcecode:: python
    
    >>> len(inventory)
    4


Dictionary methods
------------------

Dictionaries have a number of useful built-in methods.

The ``keys`` method returns what Python 3 calls a **view** of its underlying keys.  
A view object has some similarities to the ``range`` object we saw earlier ---
it is a lazy promise, to deliver its elements when they're needed by the 
rest of the program.  We can iterate over the view, or turn the view into a 
list like this:

.. sourcecode:: python
    
    for k in eng2sp.keys():     # the order in which we get the k's is not defined
       print("Got key", k, "which maps to value", eng2sp[k])     
       
    ks = list(eng2sp.keys())
    print(ks)
    
This produces this output::

    Got key three which maps to value tres
    Got key two which maps to value dos
    Got key one which maps to value uno
    ['three', 'two', 'one']
    
It is so common to iterate over the keys in a dictionary that you can
omit the ``keys`` method call in the ``for`` loop --- iterating over
a dictionary implicitly iterates over its keys:

.. sourcecode:: python
    
    for k in eng2sp:     
       print("Got key", k)     
       
 
As we saw earlier with strings and lists, dictionary methods use dot notation,
which specifies the name of the method to the right of the dot and the name of
the object on which to apply the method immediately to the left of the dot. The
parentheses indicate that this method takes no parameters.

A method call is called an **invocation**; in this case, we would say that we
are invoking the ``keys`` method on the object ``eng2sp``. As we will see in a
few chapters when we talk about object oriented programming, the object on
which a method is invoked is actually the first argument to the method.

The ``values`` method is similar; it returns a view object which can be turned
into a list:  

.. sourcecode:: python
    
    >>> list(eng2sp.values())
    ['tres', 'dos', 'uno']

The ``items`` method also returns a view, which promises a list of tuples --- one 
tuple for each key-value pair:

.. sourcecode:: python
    
    >>> list(eng2sp.items())
    [('three', 'tres'), ('two', 'dos'), ('one', 'uno')]
    
Tuples are often useful for getting both the key and the value at the same
time while you are looping:

    .. sourcecode:: python
    
       for (k,v) in eng2sp.items():
           print("Got",k,"that maps to",v)
           
This produces::

    Got three that maps to tres
    Got two that maps to dos
    Got one that maps to uno

    
The ``in`` and ``not in`` operators can test if a key is in the dictionary:

.. sourcecode:: python
    
    >>> 'one' in eng2sp
    True
    >>> 'six' in eng2sp
    False
    >>> 'tres' in eng2sp    # notice that 'in' tests against keys, not against values.
    False
     

This method can be very useful, since looking up a non-existent key in a
dictionary causes a runtime error:

.. sourcecode:: python
    
    >>> eng2esp['dog']
    Traceback (most recent call last):
      ...
    KeyError: 'dog'
    >>> 


Aliasing and copying
--------------------

Because dictionaries are mutable, you need to be aware of aliasing.  Whenever
two variables refer to the same object, changes to one affect the other.

If you want to modify a dictionary and keep a copy of the original, use the
``copy`` method. For example, ``opposites`` is a dictionary that contains pairs
of opposites:

.. sourcecode:: python
    
    >>> opposites = {'up': 'down', 'right': 'wrong', 'true': 'false'}
    >>> alias = opposites
    >>> copy = opposites.copy()

``alias`` and ``opposites`` refer to the same object; ``copy`` refers to a
fresh copy of the same dictionary. If we modify ``alias``, ``opposites`` is
also changed:

.. sourcecode:: python
    
    >>> alias['right'] = 'left'
    >>> opposites['right']
    'left'

If we modify ``copy``, ``opposites`` is unchanged:

.. sourcecode:: python
    
    >>> copy['right'] = 'privilege'
    >>> opposites['right']
    'left'


Sparse matrices
---------------

We previously used a list of lists to represent a matrix. That is a good choice
for a matrix with mostly nonzero values, but consider a `sparse matrix
<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sparse_matrix>`__ like this one:

.. image:: illustrations/sparse.png
   :alt: sparse matrix 

The list representation contains a lot of zeroes:

.. sourcecode:: python
    
    matrix = [[0, 0, 0, 1, 0],
              [0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
              [0, 2, 0, 0, 0],
              [0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
              [0, 0, 0, 3, 0]]

An alternative is to use a dictionary. For the keys, we can use tuples that
contain the row and column numbers. Here is the dictionary representation of
the same matrix:

.. sourcecode:: python
    
    matrix = {(0, 3): 1, (2, 1): 2, (4, 3): 3}

We only need three key-value pairs, one for each nonzero element of the matrix.
Each key is a tuple, and each value is an integer.

To access an element of the matrix, we could use the ``[]`` operator:

.. sourcecode:: python
    
    matrix[(0, 3)]
    1

Notice that the syntax for the dictionary representation is not the same as the
syntax for the nested list representation. Instead of two integer indices, we
use one index, which is a tuple of integers.

There is one problem. If we specify an element that is zero, we get an error,
because there is no entry in the dictionary with that key:

.. sourcecode:: python
    
    >>> matrix[(1, 3)]
    KeyError: (1, 3)

The ``get`` method solves this problem:

.. sourcecode:: python
    
    >>> matrix.get((0, 3), 0)
    1

The first argument is the key; the second argument is the value ``get`` should
return if the key is not in the dictionary:

.. sourcecode:: python
    
    >>> matrix.get((1, 3), 0)
    0

``get`` definitely improves the semantics of accessing a sparse matrix.  Shame
about the syntax.


Memos
-----

If you played around with the ``fibonacci`` function from the last chapter, you
might have noticed that the bigger the argument you provide, the longer the
function takes to run. Furthermore, the run time increases very quickly. On one
of our machines, ``fibonacci(20)`` finishes instantly, ``fibonacci(30)`` takes
about a second, and ``fibonacci(40)`` takes roughly forever.

To understand why, consider this **call graph** for ``fibonacci`` with
``n = 4``:

.. image:: illustrations/fibonacci.png
   :alt: fibonacci tree 

A call graph shows some function frames (instances when the function has
been invoked), with lines connecting each frame to
the frames of the functions it calls. At the top of the graph, ``fibonacci``
with ``n = 4`` calls ``fibonacci`` with ``n = 3`` and ``n = 2``. In turn,
``fibonacci`` with ``n = 3`` calls ``fibonacci`` with ``n = 2`` and ``n = 1``.
And so on.

Count how many times ``fibonacci(0)`` and ``fibonacci(1)`` are called.  This is
an inefficient solution to the problem, and it gets far worse as the argument
gets bigger.

A good solution is to keep track of values that have already been computed by
storing them in a dictionary. A previously computed value that is stored for
later use is called a **memo**. Here is an implementation of ``fibonacci``
using memos:

.. sourcecode:: python
    
    previous = {0: 0, 1: 1}
       
    def fibonacci(n):
        if n in previous:
            return previous[n]
        else:
            new_value = fibonacci(n-1) + fibonacci(n-2)
            previous[n] = new_value
            return new_value

The dictionary named ``previous`` keeps track of the Fibonacci numbers we
already know. We start with only two pairs: 0 maps to 1; and 1 maps to 1.

Whenever ``fibonacci`` is called, it checks the dictionary to determine if it
contains the result. If it's there, the function can return immediately without
making any more recursive calls. If not, it has to compute the new value. The
new value is added to the dictionary before the function returns.

Using this version of ``fibonacci``, our machines can compute
``fibonacci(100)`` in an eyeblink.

.. sourcecode:: python
    
    >>> fibonacci(100)
    354224848179261915075

Counting letters
----------------

In the exercises in Chapter 8 we wrote a function that counted the number of occurrences of a
letter in a string. A more general version of this problem is to form a
histogram of the letters in the string, that is, how many times each letter
appears.

Such a histogram might be useful for compressing a text file. Because different
letters appear with different frequencies, we can compress a file by using
shorter codes for common letters and longer codes for letters that appear less
frequently.

Dictionaries provide an elegant way to generate a histogram:

.. sourcecode:: python
    
    >>> letter_counts = {}
    >>> for letter in "Mississippi":
    ...   letter_counts[letter] = letter_counts.get (letter, 0) + 1
    ...
    >>> letter_counts
    {'M': 1, 's': 4, 'p': 2, 'i': 4}

We start with an empty dictionary. For each letter in the string, we find the
current count (possibly zero) and increment it. At the end, the dictionary
contains pairs of letters and their frequencies.

It might be more appealing to display the histogram in alphabetical order. We
can do that with the ``items`` and ``sort`` methods:

.. sourcecode:: python
    
    >>> letter_items = list(letter_counts.items())
    >>> letter_items.sort()
    >>> print(letter_items)
    [('M', 1), ('i', 4), ('p', 2), ('s', 4)]

Notice in the first line we had to call the type conversion function ``list``.
That turns the promise we get from ``items`` into a list, a step that is 
needed before we can use the list's ``sort`` method.
