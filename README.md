# Welcome to Skulpt

Skulpt is a Javascript implementation of Python 2.x.  Python that runs in your browser!  Python that runs on your iPad!  Its being used several projects including, [Interactive Python Textbooks](http://interactivepython.org) -- You can see skulpt in action there.  Try out [some turtle graphics examples](http://interactivepython.org/courselib/static/thinkcspy/PythonTurtle/helloturtle.html) to see Skulpt in action.

## Origins

Skulpt is the brainchild of Scott Graham.  See [Skulpt.org](http://skulpt.org) for some early demos of skulpt in action.

Brad Miller has been shepherding the development since sometime in 2010/2011.

## How can I help

There is plenty of work still to do in making improvements to Skulpt.  If you would like to contribute

1. Create a Github account if you don't already have one
2. Create a Fork of the Skulpt repository -- This will make a clone of the repository in your account.  **DO NOT** clone this one.  Once you've made the fork you will clone the forked version in your account to your local machine for development.
3. Check the issues list for something to do.
4. Fix or add your own features.  Commit and push to your forked version of the repository.  When everything is tested and ready to be incorporated into the master version...
5. Make a Pull Request to get your feature(s) added to the main repository.
