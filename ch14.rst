Classes and Objects - Digging a little deeper
=============================================


Rectangles
----------

Let's say that we want a class to represent a rectangle which is located 
somewhere in the XY plane. The question is, what information do we have 
to provide in order to specify such a rectangle? To keep things simple, 
assume that the rectangle is oriented either vertically or
horizontally, never at an angle.

There are a few possibilities: we could specify the center of the rectangle
(two coordinates) and its size (width and height); or we could specify one of
the corners and the size; or we could specify two opposing corners. A
conventional choice is to specify the upper-left corner of the rectangle and
the size.

Again, we'll define a new class, and provide it with an initializer and
a string converter method:

.. sourcecode:: python
    
    class Rectangle:
        """ A class to manufacture rectangle objects """
        
        def __init__(self, posn, w, h):
            """ Initialize a rectangle at posn, with width w and height h """
            self.corner = posn
            self.width = w
            self.height = h
            
        def __str__(self):
            return  "({0}, {1}, {2})".format(self.corner, self.width, self.height)
            
    box = Rectangle(Point(0, 0), 100, 200)
    bomb = Rectangle(Point(100, 80), 5, 10)    # in my video game
    print("box: ", box)
    print("bomb: ", bomb)     
    
To specify the upper-left corner, we have embedded an object within an object!
We create two new ``Rectangle`` objects, and then print them producing:: 

    box: ((0, 0), 100, 200)
    bomb: ((100, 80), 5, 10)

The dot operator composes. The expression ``box.corner.x`` means, Go to the
object that ``box`` refers to and select its attribute named ``corner``; then go to
that object and select its attribute named ``x``.

The figure shows the state of this object:

.. image:: illustrations/rectangle.png
   

Objects are mutable
-------------------

We can change the state of an object by making an assignment to one of
its attributes. For example, to grow the size of a rectangle without
changing its position, we could modify the values of ``width`` and
``height``:

.. sourcecode:: python
    
    box.width += 50
    box.height += 100
    
Of course, we'd probably like to provide a method to encapsulate this
inside the class.  We will also provide another method to move the 
position of the rectangle elsewhere: 

.. sourcecode:: python

        class Rectangle:
            # ...
        
            def grow(self, delta_width, delta_height):
                """ Grow (or shrink) this object by the deltas """
                self.width += delta_width
                self.height += delta_height

            def move(self, dx, dy):
                """ Move this object by the deltas """
                self.corner.x += dx
                self.corner.y += dy

Let us try this::

    >>> r = Rectangle(Point(10,5), 100, 50)
    >>> print(r)
    ((10, 5), 100, 50)
    >>> r.grow(25, -10)
    >>> print(r)
    ((10, 5), 125, 40)
    >>> r.move(-10, 10)
    print(r)
    ((0, 15), 125, 40)
                   

Sameness
--------

The meaning of the word *same* seems perfectly clear until you give it some
thought, and then you realize there is more to it than you expected.

For example, if you say, Chris and I have the same car, you mean that his car
and yours are the same make and model, but that they are two different cars. If
you say, Chris and I have the same mother, you mean that his mother and yours
are the same person.

When you talk about objects, there is a similar ambiguity. For example, if two
``Point``\ s are the same, does that mean they contain the same data
(coordinates) or that they are actually the same object?

We've already seen the ``is`` operator in the chapter on lists, where we
talked about aliases:
it allows us to find out if two references refer to the same object: 

.. sourcecode:: python
    
    >>> p1 = Point(3, 4)
    >>> p2 = Point(3, 4)
    >>> p1 is p2
    False

Even though ``p1`` and ``p2`` contain the same coordinates, they are not the
same object. If we assign ``p1`` to ``p3``, then the two variables are aliases
of the same object:

.. sourcecode:: python
    
    >>> p3 = p1
    >>> p1 is p3
    True

This type of equality is called **shallow equality** because it compares only
the references, not the contents of the objects.

To compare the contents of the objects --- **deep equality** --- we can write a
function called ``same_coordinates``:

.. sourcecode:: python
    
    def same_coordinates(p1, p2):
        return (p1.x == p2.x) and (p1.y == p2.y)

Now if we create two different objects that contain the same data, we can use
``same_point`` to find out if they represent points with the same coordinates.

.. sourcecode:: python
    
    >>> p1 = Point(3, 4)
    >>> p2 = Point(3, 4)
    >>> same_coordinates(p1, p2)
    True

Of course, if the two variables refer to the same object, they have both
shallow and deep equality.

.. admonition:: Beware of  == 

    "When I use a word," Humpty Dumpty said, in a rather scornful tone, "it means just what I choose it to mean --- neither more nor less."   *Alice in Wonderland*
    
    Python has a powerful feature that allows a designer of a class to decide what an operation
    like ``==`` or ``<`` should mean.  (We've just shown how we can control how our own objects
    are converted to strings, so we've already made a start!)  We'll cover more detail later. 
    But sometimes the implementors will attach shallow equality semantics, and 
    sometimes deep equality, as shown in this little experiment:  
    
    .. sourcecode:: python
    
        p = Point(4, 2)
        s = Point(4, 2)
        print("== on Points returns", p == s)  # by default, == does a shallow equality test here

        a = [2,3]
        b = [2,3]
        print("== on lists returns",  a == b)  # by default, == does a deep equality test on lists

    This outputs::
    
        == on Points returns False
        == on lists returns True  
        
    So we conclude that even though the two lists (or tuples, etc.) are distinct objects
    with different memory addresses, in one case the ``==`` operator tests for deep equality, 
    while in the case of points it makes a shallow test. 


   


Copying
-------

Aliasing can make a program difficult to read because changes made in
one place might have unexpected effects in another place. It is hard
to keep track of all the variables that might refer to a given object.

Copying an object is often an alternative to aliasing. The ``copy``
module contains a function called ``copy`` that can duplicate any
object:

.. sourcecode:: python

    
    >>> import copy
    >>> p1 = Point(3, 4)
    >>> p2 = copy.copy(p1)   # ugly!  <module_name>.<function_name> are identical! 
    >>> p1 is p2
    False
    >>> same_coordinates(p1, p2)
    True

Once we import the ``copy`` module, we can use the ``copy`` function to make
a new ``Point``. ``p1`` and ``p2`` are not the same point, but they contain
the same data.

To copy a simple object like a ``Point``, which doesn't contain any
embedded objects, ``copy`` is sufficient. This is called **shallow
copying**.

For something like a ``Rectangle``, which contains a reference to a
``Point``, ``copy`` doesn't do quite the right thing. It copies the
reference to the ``Point`` object, so both the old ``Rectangle`` and the
new one refer to a single ``Point``.

If we create a box, ``b1``, in the usual way and then make a copy, ``b2``,
using ``copy``, the resulting state diagram looks like this:

.. image:: illustrations/rectangle2.png

This is almost certainly not what we want. In this case, invoking
``grow`` on one of the ``Rectangles`` would not affect the other, but
invoking ``move`` on either would affect both! This behavior is
confusing and error-prone. The shallow copy has created an alias to the
Point that represents the corner. 

Fortunately, the ``copy`` module contains a function named ``deepcopy`` that
copies not only the object but also any embedded objects. You will not
be surprised to learn that this operation is called a **deep copy**.

.. sourcecode:: python

    >>> b2 = copy.deepcopy(b1)

Now ``b1`` and ``b2`` are completely separate objects.

Exercises
---------
   
#. Add a method ``area`` to the Rectangle class that returns the area of any instance::

      r = Rectangle(Point(0, 0), 10, 5)
      test(r.area(), 50)

#. Write a ``perimeter`` method in the Rectangle class so that we can find
   the perimeter of any rectangle instance::
   
      r = Rectangle(Point(0, 0), 10, 5)
      test(r.perimeter(), 30)

#. Write a ``transpose`` method in the Rectangle class that swaps the width
   and the height of any rectangle instance::
   
      r = Rectangle(Point(100, 50), 10, 5)
      test(r.width, 10)
      test(r.height, 5)
      r.flip()
      test(r.width, 5)
      test(r.height, 10)
      
#. Write a new method in the Rectangle class to test if a Point falls within
   the rectangle.  For this exercise, assume that a rectangle at (0,0) with
   width 10 and height 5 has *open* upper bounds on the width and height, 
   i.e. it stretches in the x direction from [0 to 10), where 0 is included
   but 10 is excluded, and from [0 to 5) in the y direction.  So
   it does not contain the point (10, 2).  These tests should pass::
   
      r = Rectangle(Point(0, 0), 10, 5)
      test(r.contains(Point(0, 0)), True)
      test(r.contains(Point(3, 3)), True)
      test(r.contains(Point(3, 7)), False)
      test(r.contains(Point(3, 5)), False)
      test(r.contains(Point(3, 4.99999)), True)
      test(r.contains(Point(-3, -3)), False)
   
#. In games, we often put a rectangular "bounding box" around our sprites in
   the game.  We can then do *collision detection* between, say, bombs and 
   spaceships, by comparing whether their rectangles overlap anywhere. 
   
   Write a function to determine whether two rectangles collide. *Hint:
   this might be quite a tough exercise!  Think carefully about all the
   cases before you code.*
