Preface to the Interactive Edition
==================================

by Brad Miller and David Ranum


There are many books available if you want to learn to program in Python.  In
fact, we have written a few of them ourselves.  However,
none of the books are like this one.

Programming is not a "spectator sport".  It is something you do,
something you participate in. It would make sense, then,
that the book you use to learn programming should allow you to be active.
That is our goal.

This book is meant to provide you with an interactive experience as you learn
to program in Python.  You can read the text, watch videos,
and write and execute Python code.  In addition to simply executing code,
there is a unique feature called 'codelens' that allows you to control the
flow of execution in order to gain a better understanding of how the program
works..

We have tried to use these different presentation techniques where they are
most appropriate.  In other words, sometimes it might be best to read a
description of some aspect of Python.  On a different occasion,
is might be best to execute a small example program.  Often we give you many
different options for covering the material.  Our hope is that you will find
that your understanding will be enhanced because you are able to experience
it in more than just one way.

Whats the deal with Logging in?
===============================

This edition of the book is hosted as a Google App Engine App. The reason is that for teaching
purposes we want our students to be able to save their work in a browser in the lab and get
back to it when they are in their room or in a different lab. We also wanted them to be able to
turn in homework assignments so that we can grade them. If you are a teacher and want to get
access to the grading interface contact Brad Miller. You don't need to login to use the
features of the book, but if you choose to login with any old gmail account you will be able to
save your work.

Acknowledgements
================

This interactive textbook is a triumph of open source.  Not only have we
stood on the shoulders of Jeffrey Elkner et. al. as the starting point for
the prose but the interactive features of this book also make use of open
source software.  We are indebted to Scott Graham (skulpt.org) for his open
source Python interpreter written in Javascript.  In addition we are indebted
to Philip Guo (https://github.com/pgbovine/OnlinePythonTutor/) for the Online
Python Tutor which forms the basis for Codelens.

We would also like to acknowledge the Sphinx project for their fine work in
creating a documentation system that allows us to focus on writing not
endless hours of Javascript and html coding.  In particular without the
extension architecture of Sphinx this book would not have made it off the
ground.
