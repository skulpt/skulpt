Sorting
-------

Sorting is the process of placing elements from a collection in some
kind of order. For example, a list of words could be sorted
alphabetically or by length. A list of cities could be sorted by
population, by area, or by zip code. We have already seen a number of
algorithms that were able to benefit from having a sorted list (recall
the final anagram example and the binary search).

There are many, many sorting algorithms that have been developed and
analyzed. This suggests that sorting is an important area of study in
computer science. Sorting a large number of items can take a substantial
amount of computing resources. Like searching, the efficiency of a
sorting algorithm is related to the number of items being processed. For
small collections, a complex sorting method may be more trouble than it
is worth. The overhead may be too high. On the other hand, for larger
collections, we want to take advantage of as many improvements as
possible. In this section we will discuss several sorting techniques and
compare them with respect to their running time.

Before getting into specific algorithms, we should think about the
operations that can be used to analyze a sorting process. First, it will
be necessary to compare two values to see which is smaller (or larger).
In order to sort a collection, it will be necessary to have some
systematic way to compare values to see if they are out of order. The
total number of comparisons will be the most common way to measure a
sort procedure. Second, when values are not in the correct position with
respect to one another, it may be necessary to exchange them. This
exchange is a costly operation and the total number of exchanges will
also be important for evaluating the overall efficiency of the
algorithm.

The Bubble Sort
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The **bubble sort** makes multiple passes through a list. It compares
adjacent items and exchanges those that are out of order. Each pass
through the list places the next largest value in its proper place. In
essence, each item “bubbles” up to the location where it belongs.

:ref:`Figure 1 <fig_bubblepass>` shows the first pass of a bubble sort. The shaded
items are being compared to see if they are out of order. If there are
*n* items in the list, then there are :math:`n-1` pairs of items that
need to be compared on the first pass. It is important to note that once
the largest value in the list is part of a pair, it will continually be
moved along until the pass is complete.

.. _fig_bubblepass:

.. figure:: Figures/bubblepass.png
   :align: center

   ``bubbleSort``: The First Pass


At the start of the second pass, the largest value is now in place.
There are :math:`n-1` items left to sort, meaning that there will be
:math:`n-2` pairs. Since each pass places the next largest value in
place, the total number of passes necessary will be :math:`n-1`. After
completing the :math:`n-1` passes, the smallest item must be in the
correct position with no further processing required. :ref:`Listing 1 <lst_bubble>`
shows the complete ``bubbleSort`` function. It takes the list as a
parameter, and modifies it by exchanging items as necessary.

The exchange operation, sometimes called a “swap,” is slightly different
in Python than in most other programming languages. Typically, swapping
two elements in a list requires a temporary storage location (an
additional memory location). A code fragment such as

::

    temp = alist[i]
    alist[i] = alist[j]
    alist[j] = temp

will exchange the `ith` and `jth` items in the list. Without the
temporary storage, one of the values would be overwritten.

In Python, it is possible to perform simultaneous assignment. The
statement ``a,b=b,a`` will result in two assignment statements being
done at the same time (see :ref:`Figure 2 <fig_pythonswap>`). Using simultaneous
assignment, the exchange operation can be done in one statement.

Lines 5-7 in :ref:`Listing 1 <lst_bubble>` perform the exchange of the :math:`i` and
:math:(i+1)th items using the three–step procedure described
earlier. Note that we could also have used the simultaneous assignment
to swap the items.

   Exchanging Two Values in Python

The following activecode example shows the complete ``bubbleSort`` function working on the list
shown above.


.. _lst_bubble:

.. activecode:: lst_bubble

    def bubbleSort(alist):
        for passnum in range(len(alist)-1,0,-1):
            for i in range(passnum):
                if alist[i]>alist[i+1]:
                    temp = alist[i]
                    alist[i] = alist[i+1]
                    alist[i+1] = temp

    alist = [54,26,93,17,77,31,44,55,20]
    bubbleSort(alist)
    print(alist)

The following animation shows ``bubbleSort`` in action.

   :model: BubbleSortModel

For more detail, use codelens to step thru the algorithm.

.. codelens:: bubbletrace
    
    def bubbleSort(alist):
        for passnum in range(len(alist)-1,0,-1):
            for i in range(passnum):
                if alist[i]>alist[i+1]:
                    temp = alist[i]
                    alist[i] = alist[i+1]
                    alist[i+1] = temp
    
    alist = [54,26,93,17,77,31,44,55,20]
    bubbleSort(alist)    
    print(alist)       
                    

To analyze the bubble sort, we should note that regardless of how the
items are arranged in the initial list, :math:`n-1` passes will be
made to sort a list of size *n*. :ref:`Table 1 <tbl_bubbleanalysis>` shows the number
of comparisons for each pass. The total number of comparisons is the sum
of the first :math:`n-1` integers. Recall that the sum of the first
*n* integers is :math:`\frac{1}{2}n^{2} + \frac{1}{2}n`. The sum of
the first :math:`n-1` integers is
:math:`\frac{1}{2}n^{2} + \frac{1}{2}n - n`, which is
:math:`\frac{1}{2}n^{2} - \frac{1}{2}n`. This is still
:math:`O(n^{2})` comparisons. In the best case, if the list is already
ordered, no exchanges will be made. However, in the worst case, every
comparison will cause an exchange. On average, we exchange half of the
time.

    Comparisons for Each Pass of Bubble Sort

A bubble sort is often considered the most inefficient sorting method
since it must exchange items before the final location is known. These
“wasted” exchange operations are very costly. However, because the
bubble sort makes passes through the entire unsorted portion of the
list, it has the capability to do something most sorting algorithms
cannot. In particular, if during a pass there are no exchanges, then we
know that the list must be sorted. A bubble sort can be modified to stop
early if it finds that the list has become sorted. This means that for
lists that require just a few passes, a bubble sort may have an
advantage in that it will recognize the sorted list and stop.
:ref:`Listing 2 <lst_shortbubble>` shows this modification, which is often referred
to as the **short bubble**.

.. _lst_shortbubble:

.. activecode:: lst_shortbubble

    def shortBubbleSort(alist):
        exchanges = True
        passnum = len(alist)-1
        while passnum > 0 and exchanges:
           exchanges = False
           for i in range(passnum):
               if alist[i]>alist[i+1]:
                   exchanges = True
                   temp = alist[i]
                   alist[i] = alist[i+1]
                   alist[i+1] = temp
           passnum = passnum-1

    alist=[20,30,40,90,50,60,70,80,100,110]
    shortBubbleSort(alist)
    print(alist)
    
Finally, here is ``shortBubbleSort`` in codelens.
    
.. codelens:: shortbubbletrace

    def shortBubbleSort(alist):
        exchanges = True
        passnum = len(alist)-1
        while passnum > 0 and exchanges:
           exchanges = False
           for i in range(passnum):
               if alist[i]>alist[i+1]:
                   exchanges = True
                   temp = alist[i]
                   alist[i] = alist[i+1]
                   alist[i+1] = temp
           passnum = passnum-1

    alist=[20,30,40,90,50,60,70,80,100,110]
    shortBubbleSort(alist)
    print(alist)
 
 
 
 
The Selection Sort
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The **selection sort** improves on the bubble sort by making only one
exchange for every pass through the list. In order to do this, a
selection sort looks for the largest value as it makes a pass and, after
completing the pass, places it in the proper location. As with a bubble
sort, after the first pass, the largest item is in the correct place.
After the second pass, the next largest is in place. This process
continues and requires :math:`n-1` passes to sort *n* items, since the
final item must be in place after the :math:`(n-1)` st pass.

:ref:`Figure 3 <fig_selectionsort>` shows the entire sorting process. On each pass,
the largest remaining item is selected and then placed in its proper
location. The first pass places 93, the second pass places 77, the third
places 55, and so on. The function is shown in
:ref:`Listing 3 <lst_selectionsortcode>`.

.. _fig_selectionsort:

.. figure:: Figures/selectionsort.png
   :align: center

   ``selectionSort``


.. _lst_selectionsortcode:


.. activecode:: lst_selectionsortcode

    def selectionSort(alist):
       for fillslot in range(len(alist)-1,0,-1):
           positionOfMax=0
           for location in range(1,fillslot+1):
               if alist[location]>alist[positionOfMax]:
                   positionOfMax = location

           temp = alist[fillslot]
           alist[fillslot] = alist[positionOfMax]
           alist[positionOfMax] = temp

    alist = [54,26,93,17,77,31,44,55,20]
    selectionSort(alist)
    print(alist)

.. animation:: selection_anim
   :modelfile: sortmodels.js
   :viewerfile: sortviewers.js
   :model: SelectionSortModel
   :viewer: BarViewer
   
   
.. codelens:: selectionsortcodetrace

    def selectionSort(alist):
       for fillslot in range(len(alist)-1,0,-1):
           positionOfMax=0
           for location in range(1,fillslot+1):
               if alist[location]>alist[positionOfMax]:
                   positionOfMax = location

           temp = alist[fillslot]
           alist[fillslot] = alist[positionOfMax]
           alist[positionOfMax] = temp

    alist = [54,26,93,17,77,31,44,55,20]
    selectionSort(alist)
    print(alist)

You may see that the selection sort makes the same number of comparisons
as the bubble sort and is therefore also :math:`O(n^{2})`. However,
due to the reduction in the number of exchanges, the selection sort
typically executes faster in benchmark studies. In fact, for our list,
the bubble sort makes 20 exchanges, while the selection sort makes only
8.

The Insertion Sort
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The **insertion sort**, although still :math:`O(n^{2})`, works in a
slightly different way. It always maintains a sorted sublist in the
lower positions of the list. Each new item is then “inserted” back into
the previous sublist such that the sorted sublist is one item larger.
:ref:`Figure 4 <fig_insertionsort>` shows the insertion sorting process. The shaded
items represent the ordered sublists as the algorithm makes each pass.

.. _fig_insertionsort:

.. figure:: Figures/insertionsort.png
   :align: center

   ``insertionSort``


We begin by assuming that a list with one item (position :math:`0`) is
already sorted. On each pass, one for each item 1 through :math:`n-1`,
the current item is checked against those in the already sorted sublist.
As we look back into the already sorted sublist, we shift those items
that are greater to the right. When we reach a smaller item or the end
of the sublist, the current item can be inserted.

:ref:`Figure 5 <fig_insertionpass>` shows the fifth pass in detail. At this point in
the algorithm, a sorted sublist of five items consisting of 17, 26, 54,
77, and 93 exists. We want to insert 31 back into the already sorted
items. The first comparison against 93 causes 93 to be shifted to the
right. 77 and 54 are also shifted. When the item 26 is encountered, the
shifting process stops and 31 is placed in the open position. Now we
have a sorted sublist of six items.

.. _fig_insertionpass:

.. figure:: Figures/insertionpass.png
   :align: center

   ``insertionSort``: Fifth Pass of the Sort


The implementation of ``insertionSort`` (:ref:`Listing 4 <lst_insertion>`) shows that
there are again :math:`n-1` passes to sort *n* items. The iteration
starts at position 1 and moves through position :math:`n-1`, as these
are the items that need to be inserted back into the sorted sublists.
Line 8 performs the shift operation that moves a value up one position
in the list, making room behind it for the insertion. Remember that this
is not a complete exchange as was performed in the previous algorithms.

The maximum number of comparisons for an insertion sort is the sum of
the first :math:`n-1` integers. Again, this is :math:`O(n^{2})`.
However, in the best case, only one comparison needs to be done on each
pass. This would be the case for an already sorted list.

One note about shifting versus exchanging is also important. In general,
a shift operation requires approximately a third of the processing work
of an exchange since only one assignment is performed. In benchmark
studies, insertion sort will show very good performance.

.. _lst_insertion:

.. activecode:: lst_insertion

    def insertionSort(alist):
       for index in range(1,len(alist)):

         currentvalue = alist[index]
         position = index

         while position>0 and alist[position-1]>currentvalue:
             alist[position]=alist[position-1]
             position = position-1

         alist[position]=currentvalue

    alist = [54,26,93,17,77,31,44,55,20]
    insertionSort(alist)
    print(alist)

.. animation:: insertion_anim
   :modelfile: sortmodels.js
   :viewerfile: sortviewers.js
   :model: InsertionSortModel
   :viewer: BoxViewer


.. codelens:: insertionsortcodetrace

    def insertionSort(alist):
       for index in range(1,len(alist)):

         currentvalue = alist[index]
         position = index

         while position>0 and alist[position-1]>currentvalue:
             alist[position]=alist[position-1]
             position = position-1

         alist[position]=currentvalue

    alist = [54,26,93,17,77,31,44,55,20]
    insertionSort(alist)
    print(alist)

The Shell Sort
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The **shell sort**, sometimes called the “diminishing increment sort,”
improves on the insertion sort by breaking the original list into a
number of smaller sublists, each of which is sorted using an insertion
sort. The unique way that these sublists are chosen is the key to the
shell sort. Instead of breaking the list into sublists of contiguous
items, the shell sort uses an increment ``i``, sometimes called the
**gap**, to create a sublist by choosing all items that are ``i`` items
apart.

This can be seen in :ref:`Figure 6 <fig_incrementsA>`. This list has nine items. If
we use an increment of three, there are three sublists, each of which
can be sorted by an insertion sort. After completing these sorts, we get
the list shown in :ref:`Figure 7 <fig_incrementsB>`. Although this list is not
completely sorted, something very interesting has happened. By sorting
the sublists, we have moved the items closer to where they actually
belong.

.. _fig_incrementsA:

.. _fig_incrementsB:

.. figure:: Figures/shellsortB.png
   :align: center

   A Shell Sort after Sorting Each Sublist


:ref:`Figure 8 <fig_incrementsC>` shows a final insertion sort using an increment of
one; in other words, a standard insertion sort. Note that by performing
the earlier sublist sorts, we have now reduced the total number of
shifting operations necessary to put the list in its final order. For
this case, we need only four more shifts to complete the process.

.. _fig_incrementsC:

   :align: center

   ShellSort: A Final Insertion Sort with Increment of 1


.. _fig_incrementsD:

.. figure:: Figures/shellsortD.png
   :align: center

   Initial Sublists for a Shell Sort


We said earlier that the way in which the increments are chosen is the
unique feature of the shell sort. The function shown in :ref:`Listing 5 <lst_shell>`
uses a different set of increments. In this case, we begin with
:math:`\frac {n}{2}` sublists. On the next pass,
:math:`\frac {n}{4}` sublists are sorted. Eventually, a single list is
sorted with the basic insertion sort. :ref:`Figure 9 <fig_incrementsD>` shows the
first sublists for our example using this increment.

The following invocation of the ``shellSort`` function shows the
partially sorted lists after each increment, with the final sort being
an insertion sort with an increment of one.

.. _lst_shell:

.. activecode:: lst_shellSort

    def shellSort(alist):
        sublistcount = len(alist)//2
        while sublistcount > 0:

          for startposition in range(sublistcount):
            gapInsertionSort(alist,startposition,sublistcount)

          print("After increments of size",sublistcount,
                                       "The list is",alist)

          sublistcount = sublistcount // 2

    def gapInsertionSort(alist,start,gap):
        for i in range(start+gap,len(alist),gap):

            currentvalue = alist[i]
            position = i

            while position>=gap and alist[position-gap]>currentvalue:
                alist[position]=alist[position-gap] 
                position = position-gap

            alist[position]=currentvalue
            
    alist = [54,26,93,17,77,31,44,55,20]
    shellSort(alist)
    print(alist)



.. animation:: shell_anim

   :viewer: BarViewer

.. codelens:: shellSorttrace

    def shellSort(alist):
        sublistcount = len(alist)//2
        while sublistcount > 0:

          for startposition in range(sublistcount):
            gapInsertionSort(alist,startposition,sublistcount)

          print("After increments of size",sublistcount,
                                       "The list is",alist)

          sublistcount = sublistcount // 2

    def gapInsertionSort(alist,start,gap):
        for i in range(start+gap,len(alist),gap):

            currentvalue = alist[i]
            position = i

            while position>=gap and alist[position-gap]>currentvalue:
                alist[position]=alist[position-gap] 
                position = position-gap

            alist[position]=currentvalue
            
    alist = [54,26,93,17,77,31,44,55,20]
    #shellSort(alist)
    print(alist)



At first glance you may think that a shell sort cannot be better than an
insertion sort, since it does a complete insertion sort as the last
step. It turns out, however, that this final insertion sort does not
need to do very many comparisons (or shifts) since the list has been
pre-sorted by earlier incremental insertion sorts, as described above.
In other words, each pass produces a list that is “more sorted” than the
previous one. This makes the final pass very efficient.

Although a general analysis of the shell sort is well beyond the scope
of this text, we can say that it tends to fall somewhere between
:math:`O(n)` and :math:`O(n^{2})`, based on the behavior described
above. For the increments shown in :ref:`Listing 5 <lst_shell>`, the performance is
:math:`O(n^{2})`. By changing the increment, for example using
:math:`2^{k}-1` (1, 3, 7, 15, 31, and so on), a shell sort can perform
at :math:`O(n^{\frac {3}{2}})`.

The Merge Sort
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

We now turn our attention to using a divide and conquer strategy as a
way to improve the performance of sorting algorithms. The first
algorithm we will study is the **merge sort**. Merge sort is a recursive
algorithm that continually splits a list in half. If the list is empty
or has one item, it is sorted by definition (the base case). If the list
has more than one item, we split the list and recursively invoke a merge
sort on both halves. Once the two halves are sorted, the fundamental
operation, called a **merge**, is performed. Merging is the process of
taking two smaller sorted lists and combining them together into a
single, sorted, new list. :ref:`Figure 10 <fig_mergesortA>` shows our familiar example
list as it is being split by ``mergeSort``. :ref:`Figure 11 <fig_mergesortB>` shows
the simple lists, now sorted, as they are merged back together.

.. _fig_mergesortB:

.. figure:: Figures/mergesortB.png
   :align: center

   Lists as They Are Merged Together



The ``mergeSort`` function shown in :ref:`Listing 6 <lst_merge>` begins by asking the
base case question. If the length of the list is less than or equal to
one, then we already have a sorted list and no more processing is
necessary. If, on the other hand, the length is greater than one, then
we use the Python ``slice`` operation to extract the left and right
halves. It is important to note that the list may not have an even
number of items. That does not matter, as the lengths will differ by at
most one.

.. _lst_merge:

.. activecode:: lst_merge

    def mergeSort(alist):
        print("Splitting ",alist)
        if len(alist)>1:
            mid = len(alist)//2
            lefthalf = alist[:mid]
            righthalf = alist[mid:]

            mergeSort(lefthalf)
            mergeSort(righthalf)

            i=0
            j=0
            k=0
            while i<len(lefthalf) and j<len(righthalf):
                if lefthalf[i]<righthalf[j]:
                    alist[k]=lefthalf[i]
                    i=i+1
                else:
                    alist[k]=righthalf[j]
                    j=j+1
                k=k+1

            while i<len(lefthalf):
                alist[k]=lefthalf[i]
                i=i+1
                k=k+1

            while j<len(righthalf):

Once the ``mergeSort`` function is invoked on the left half and the
right half (lines 8–9), it is assumed they are sorted. The rest of the
function (lines 11–31) is responsible for merging the two smaller sorted
lists into a larger sorted list. Notice that the merge operation places
the items back into the original list (``alist``) one at a time by
repeatedly taking the smallest item from the sorted lists.

The ``mergeSort`` function has been augmented with a ``print`` statement
(line 2) to show the contents of the list being sorted at the start of
each invocation. There is also a ``print`` statement (line 32) to show
the merging process. The transcript shows the result of executing the
function on our example list. Note that the list with 44, 55, and 20
will not divide evenly. The first split gives [44] and the second gives
[55,20]. It is easy to see how the splitting process eventually yields a
list that can be immediately merged with other sorted lists.

In order to analyze the ``mergeSort`` function, we need to consider the
two distinct processes that make up its implementation. First, the list
is split into halves. We already computed (in a binary search) that we
can divide a list in half :math:`\log n` times where *n* is the
length of the list. The second process is the merge. Each item in the
list will eventually be processed and placed on the sorted list. So the
merge operation which results in a list of size *n* requires *n*
operations. The result of this analysis is that :math:`\log n` splits,
each of which costs :math:`n` for a total of :math:`n\log n`
operations. A merge sort is an :math:`O(n\log n)` algorithm.

Recall that the slicing operator is :math:`O(k)` where k is the size
of the slice. In order to guarantee that ``mergeSort`` will be
:math:`O(n\log n)` we will need to remove the slice operator. Again,
this is possible if we simply pass the starting and ending indices along
with the list when we make the recursive call. We leave this as an
exercise.

It is important to notice that the ``mergeSort`` function requires extra
space to hold the two halves as they are extracted with the slicing
operations. This additional space can be a critical factor if the list
is large and can make this sort problematic when working on large data
sets.

The Quick Sort
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The **quick sort** uses divide and conquer to gain the same advantages
as the merge sort, while not using additional storage. As a trade-off,
however, it is possible that the list may not be divided in half. When
this happens, we will see that performance is diminished.

A quick sort first selects a value, which is called the **pivot value**.
Although there are many different ways to choose the pivot value, we
will simply use the first item in the list. The role of the pivot value
is to assist with splitting the list. The actual position where the
pivot value belongs in the final sorted list, commonly called the
**split point**, will be used to divide the list for subsequent calls to
the quick sort.

:ref:`Figure 12 <fig_splitvalue>` shows that 54 will serve as our first pivot value.
Since we have looked at this example a few times already, we know that
54 will eventually end up in the position currently holding 31. The
**partition** process will happen next. It will find the split point and
at the same time move other items to the appropriate side of the list,
either less than or greater than the pivot value.

   The First Pivot Value for a Quick Sort





Partitioning begins by locating two position markers—let’s call them
``leftmark`` and ``rightmark``—at the beginning and end of the remaining
items in the list (positions 1 and 8 in :ref:`Figure 13 <fig_partitionA>`). The goal
of the partition process is to move items that are on the wrong side
with respect to the pivot value while also converging on the split
point. :ref:`Figure 13 <fig_partitionA>` shows this process as we locate the position
of 54.

.. _fig_partitionA:

.. figure:: Figures/partitionA.png
   :align: center

   Finding the Split Point for 54

We begin by incrementing ``leftmark`` until we locate a value that is
greater than the pivot value. We then decrement ``rightmark`` until we
find a value that is less than the pivot value. At this point we have
discovered two items that are out of place with respect to the eventual
split point. For our example, this occurs at 93 and 20. Now we can
exchange these two items and then repeat the process again.

At the point where ``rightmark`` becomes less than ``leftmark``, we
stop. The position of ``rightmark`` is now the split point. The pivot
value can be exchanged with the contents of the split point and the
pivot value is now in place (:ref:`Figure 14 <fig_partitionB>`). In addition, all the
items to the left of the split point are less than the pivot value, and
all the items to the right of the split point are greater than the pivot
value. The list can now be divided at the split point and the quick sort
can be invoked recursively on the two halves.

   Completing the Partition Process to Find the Split Point for 54


The ``quickSort`` function shown in :ref:`Listing 7 <lst_quick>` invokes a recursive
function, ``quickSortHelper``. ``quickSortHelper`` begins with the same
base case as the merge sort. If the length of the list is less than or
equal to one, it is already sorted. If it is greater, then it can be
partitioned and recursively sorted. The ``partition`` function
implements the process described earlier.

           splitpoint = partition(alist,first,last)

           quickSortHelper(alist,first,splitpoint-1)

           while alist[rightmark] >= pivotvalue and \
                   rightmark >= leftmark:

    print(alist)

To analyze the ``quickSort`` function, note that for a list of length
*n*, if the partition always occurs in the middle of the list, there
will again be :math:`\log n` divisions. In order to find the split
point, each of the *n* items needs to be checked against the pivot
value. The result is :math:`n\log n`. In addition, there is no need
for additional memory as in the merge sort process.

Unfortunately, in the worst case, the split points may not be in the
middle and can be very skewed to the left or the right, leaving a very
uneven division. In this case, sorting a list of *n* items divides into
sorting a list of 0 items and a list of :math:`n-1` items. Then
sorting a list of :math:`n-1` divides into a list of size 0 and a list
of size :math:`n-2`, and so on. The result is an :math:`O(n^{2})`
sort with all of the overhead that recursion requires.

We mentioned earlier that there are different ways to choose the pivot
value. In particular, we can attempt to alleviate some of the potential
for an uneven division by using a technique called **median of three**.
To choose the pivot value, we will consider the first, the middle, and
the last element in the list. In our example, those are 54, 77, and 20.
Now pick the median value, in our case 54, and use it for the pivot
value (of course, that was the pivot value we used originally). The idea
is that in the case where the the first item in the list does not belong
toward the middle of the list, the median of three will choose a better
“middle” value. This will be particularly useful when the original list
is somewhat sorted to begin with. We leave the implementation of this
pivot value selection as an exercise.
